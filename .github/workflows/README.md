# This folder contains GitHub Actions workflows

Workflows are used to build and deploy the `cash-account` service.

This file describes the workflows that are used to compile the app, build the Docker image, and publish it to either Azure Container Registry (ACR) or Amazon ECR, and update the GitOps repository for deployment.

Workflows are defined in the following files:
- [build-test-push-azure-acr.yml](build-test-push-azure-acr.yml)
- [build-test-push-aws-ecr.yml](build-test-push-aws-ecr.yml)

Copy these workflows to other microservices and change the following settings in the `env` section of the workflow file:
```
  # EDIT secrets with your registry, registry path, and credentials
  ACR_NAME: <your-acr-name>
  IMAGE_NAME: cash-account
  APP_NAME: cash-account
  GITOPS_REPO: <your-gitops-repo>
  GITOPS_DIR: application
  GITOPS_USERNAME: ${{ secrets.GITOPS_USERNAME }}
  GITOPS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITOPS_TOKEN }}
```

GitOps registry is where the StockTrader custom resource file is stored. The workflow updates that file with the new image location and tag.

Additionally, you need to configure the following secrets in your application git repo:
```
# For Azure workflow:
AZURE_CLIENT_ID - Azure App Registration or Managed Identity client ID
AZURE_TENANT_ID - Azure tenant ID
AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID - Azure subscription ID
GITOPS_TOKEN - GitHub PAT with write access to your GitOps repo
GITOPS_USERNAME - Your GitHub username
ACR_LOGIN_SERVER - Your ACR login server (e.g., <acr-name>.azurecr.io)

# For AWS workflow:
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID - AWS IAM user access key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY - AWS IAM user secret access key
GITOPS_TOKEN - GitHub PAT with write access to your GitOps repo
GITOPS_USERNAME - Your GitHub username
```

## Azure Workflow
This workflow:
- Builds the application using Maven
- Pushes the Docker image to Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Updates the GitOps repository with the new image tag for AKS deployment

### Required Azure Setup
1. Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
2. Set up AKS cluster with StockTrader operator
3. Fork or create a GitOps repo for deployment manifests

## AWS Workflow
This workflow:
- Builds the application using Maven
- Pushes the Docker image to Amazon ECR
- Updates the GitOps repository with the new image tag for ECS/EKS deployment

### Required AWS Setup
1. Create an Amazon ECR repository
2. Set up ECS/EKS cluster and task definitions
3. Fork or create a GitOps repo for deployment manifests

### Environment Variables
The workflows use these environment variables:
```
ACR_NAME - Your Azure Container Registry name (Azure only)
GITOPS_REPO - Your GitOps repository (format: username/repo)
GITOPS_DIR - Directory containing deployment manifests
IMAGE_NAME - Name of your Docker image
APP_NAME - Name of your application
IMAGE_TAG - Image tag (defaults to GitHub commit SHA)
```

## Disable other workflows
If this repo contains other workflows you do not need, you can disable or remove them.
To disable a workflow, go to `Actions`, select the workflow, click the `...` menu, and click `Disable workflow`.
You can re-enable the workflow later in the same way.
